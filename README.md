# MIPT-grades

In this article, the dependence of students' academic performance and their average score on
various signs such as smoking, the frequency of outdoor walks, sports, etc. was investigated.
A survey was conducted among students, in which 230 students of various courses of MIPT took part.
The paper presents the results of the survey. A model has been trained to obtain a predicted average score.
